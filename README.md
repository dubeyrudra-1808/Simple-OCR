# IMG_TEXT: Image-to-Text and Text-based Image Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates a pipeline for handling both image and text data. It includes capabilities such as:
- Extracting and analyzing text from images (OCR)
- Generating captions or descriptions from images
- Performing text-based image retrieval or classification
- Using vision-language models for multimodal analysis

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV / PIL for image handling
- Tesseract OCR or any pre-trained OCR models
- Transformers (HuggingFace) for image captioning or multimodal models
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (depending on the model used)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dubeyrudra-1808/Simple-OCR
   cd Simple-OCR
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip` or `conda`.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download models**
   The notebook uses HuggingFace's pre-trained models, make sure to run the cells that download them.

4. **Run the notebook**
   Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open `IMG_TEXT.ipynb`.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook IMG_TEXT.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Use Cases

- Digitizing handwritten or printed documents.
- Creating image captions automatically.
- Searching for images based on text queries.
- Analyzing scanned documents with both visual and textual content.
